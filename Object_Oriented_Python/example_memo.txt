This is a random text file created for the use as a test case in the profanity_editor.py
script. The intent of the script is to search for curse words inside text, such as this
file and remove them.

It will attempt to remove words such as "ass", "shit", etc.

So, now that this has been discussed, maybe we should take a shit at trying to figure this
out. Ass uming that the script works as intended, there may be some differences once the
script has finished its job.
